\textbf{Overall Purpose:} Collecting the data from the product test, the re-design will allow for a “second chance” to correct the mistakes, and re-evaluate the conceptual design. Here we show that we understand how to use the data from an evaluation to leap forward, and re-design based on experience.

\noindent\textbf{Structure:} From evaluation to re-design, show mistakes and solutions.
