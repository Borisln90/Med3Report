\section{Naïve designs}
The way this report is approached, is slightly different than usual - Normally the problem is approached by coming up with an idea of what to work with, then do some initial research (investigation) with the goal of turning the idea into an initial problem statement, which is then used to narrow the field of research into an analysis, with the goal of turning the initial problem into a final problem statement.

This report structure is somewhat similar in content, but different in approach:
Instead of starting by coming up with a general idea, the first step was to come up with an initial problem statement.

This problem statement was then used as a framework for creating some basic (naïve) designs, in order to figure out, in which direction the report should go, before doing any specific research.

These designs are then used to figure out which areas research should be focused on (i.e. they effectively work as an investigation chapter).
\bigskip

The reason this approach is used, is to increase efficiency and broadening the perspective of possible solutions to a problem - instead of doing a lot of preliminary research on a subject, in order to create a problem statement, the order is reversed, which reduces the amount of work that "goes to waste" (i.e. ends up not being important for the report), and instead of locking upon a single solution, this approach tries to focus on many possibilities of solving a problem.
