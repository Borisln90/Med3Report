\section{Naïve designs}
The usual structure of a project like this starts with developing an idea of some problem and formulate this into an initial problem statement. This is followed by doing some initial research, called investigation, with the goal of turning the idea into an final and more specific problem statement, which is then used to narrow the field of research into an analysis, with the goal of specifying a list of requirements for a design.

This report structure here is somewhat similar in content, but different in approach:
After defining the initial problem statement it is used as a framework for creating some naïve designs. These designs are then used to figure out which areas of research should be focused on, i.e. they effectively work as the investigation chapter.
\bigskip

The reason this approach is used, is to increase efficiency and broadening the perspective of possible solutions to a problem. Instead of doing a lot of preliminary research on a subject, in order to create a final problem statement, the order is reversed, which reduces the amount of work that "goes to waste" i.e. ends up not being important for the project, and instead of risking locking upon a single solution, this approach tries to focus on many possibilities to solve a problem.
