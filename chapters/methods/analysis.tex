\subsection{Analysis}
As our group learned which subjects that should be focused on from the Na√Øve designs. The analysis is a simple; yet time consuming process to execute. The group got to research each focus point and get the information required in order to create a final problem statement (FPS) that will for fill our requirements to this project. The focus points in this analysis will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item What have others done before us? \newline
The group is going to research State of the Art (SOTA) to experience what others 	have created, to learn from their mistakes and to find inspiration for our projects. 

\item How does Image Processing work? \newline
The group is going to research Image Processing to be able to understand how the 	process work and be able to use the information that has been learned to create a product that works and is capable to produce data that can be used for evaluating.

\item Can we form our gestures so the volunteers feel comfortable during tests? \newline
If the group wants results that can be used later on a good test has to be performed. In order to achieve this we want our volunteers to feel comfortable and use gestures that feel natural to them. 

\end{itemize}

When these steps have been followed the group should be ready to form our FPS. The group is then going to use this FPS to create new designs based on the new information gained in the analysis and then be able to move forward to our design phase.
