\subsection{Design}
The approach in the design chapter is to conceptualize a design based on the List of Requirements assembled through the analysis. This List of Requirements is used in the design in order to ensure that the final product will fulfill all the demands established during the research in the analysis. During the design-process, there will be some low-fi prototype tests in order to ensure that the concept behind the design is understandable and usable by users unaware of the prior research leading to the described design.
 
Instead of locking onto one design, the chapter will try to conceptualize multiple design ideas, thus trying to put focus on different areas researched in the analysis. This should give the possibility to merge strong parts of either design in order to create a final design that will be implemented into the final product.
