\subsection{Implementation}
In order to create an artifact which can be used for testing with satisfactory results, and serve as a baseline for further evolution, the product is intended to be implemented as a horizontal prototype. Horizontal design, as opposed to vertical design, focuses mainly on providing a functioning prototype that may not be esthetically pleasing to behold, while vertical design focuses on the detail and less on the functionality of the prototype \parencite{Rogers2002}. This means that, based on the conceptual design as well as the list of requirements, a prototype will be created which will function nearly as well as the potentially completed product, but in a crude state. The implementation will be split up into two parts, the video game, and the physical interface. The physical interface should be able to interact with the game. For the physical interface we intent to use sensors to get input from the users.
