\section{Evaluation}
The following categories cover the similarities of patterns, behaviors, opinions and miscellaneous issues that reside in the data. 
All data elements are categorized into one of the mentioned categories by utilizing color coding. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \colorbox{NotLavender}{Delay activating functions}
\item \colorbox{NotGreenYellow}{Acceleration, Reverse/braking relevance}
\item \colorbox{NotSkyBlue}{Change camera view relevance}
\item \colorbox{NotOrange}{Turning relevance}
\item \colorbox{NotRed}{Subject comments and actions}
\item \colorbox{NotGreen}{Game and in-game crashes}
\item \colorbox{NotPurple}{Frame rate relevance}

\end{itemize}

\begin{tabular}{| p{3.4in} | p{2in} |}
\hline
\textbf{Test Subject \# 1: Product} & \textbf{SOTA}\\
\hline
\cellcolor{NotLavender}• Slight function delay & \cellcolor{NotRed}• Easier to control\\
\cellcolor{NotGreenYellow}• Breaking was non responsive. Wheel was not forward enough to enable it. & \cellcolor{NotRed}• Faster function response.\\
\cellcolor{NotGreenYellow}• The wheel was placed very far forward, in order to accelerate. & \\
\cellcolor{NotSkyBlue}• Random activation of the camera view change. Occurred +5 times. & \\
\cellcolor{NotOrange}• Over exaggerated the turning motion to turn. & \\
\cellcolor{NotSkyBlue}• After practice, enabling the “change view” was improved and functional & \\
\cellcolor{NotSkyBlue}• Change view happens for no reason. & \\
\cellcolor{NotSkyBlue}• Camera change view is enabled by flipping the wheel over the shoulder. & \\
\cellcolor{NotRed}•	Subject quote: “shoulder hurts” & \\
\cellcolor{NotGreenYellow}•	Subject rarely breaks. & \\
\cellcolor{NotGreen}•	No in-game crashes. & \\
\hline\hline

\textbf{Test Subject \# 2: Product} & \textbf{SOTA}\\
\hline
\cellcolor{NotGreenYellow}•	No noticeable braking during race & \cellcolor{NotOrange}•	Several occasions: Car was wobbling. Hard left, or hard right.\\
\cellcolor{NotSkyBlue}•	Change camera is enabled several times on purpose during game & \cellcolor{NotGreen}•	In game crash\\
\cellcolor{NotGreen}•	Game was reset because of technical difficulties – not associated with product. & \cellcolor{NotRed}•	Over eager\\
\cellcolor{NotRed}•	Wheel (board) was tilted, excessively when car was out of control (things were going bad). & \\
\cellcolor{NotOrange}•	Several occasions: Car was wobbling. Hard left, or hard right. & \\
\cellcolor{NotRed}•	Arms of subject are placed very low. Near thighs in the sitting position. & \\
\cellcolor{NotRed}•	Noticeable frustration of the test subject. & \\
\cellcolor{NotLavender}•	Slight function delay & \\
\cellcolor{NotSkyBlue}•	Tried to enable “change view”. Nothing happened & \\
\cellcolor{NotGreenYellow}•	Lost control of the forward/backward mechanics  - Trouble activating them after the other. & \\
\cellcolor{NotRed}•	Kept arms straight, (wheel close to screen) while driving. & \\
\cellcolor{NotSkyBlue}•	Random change of view occurred 3-4 times. & \\
\cellcolor{NotRed}•	After in game crash, subject had difficulties getting control over the vehicle, getting back on track. Forward/backward \& turning. & \\
\cellcolor{NotSkyBlue}•	Change of view was activated once on purpose. & \\
