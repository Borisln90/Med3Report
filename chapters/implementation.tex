\section{Implementation}
\textbf{Overall purpose:} show how the conceptual design from the Design-chapter was built in practice. (code, set-up, obstacles, solutions)

\noindent\textbf{Note:} if something from the Design-chapter could not be implemented (due to whatever reason) elaborate on it here, so the user will not think about it anymore.
