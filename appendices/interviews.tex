	\begin{itemize}
        \item Experienced varied function delays which was annoying.
        \item Yes. Mainly when  I changed view.
        \item Yes. Continuously delays. Typical a second or more.
        \item When you turned, there was a short delay. More when you break. To get it to break, it took a long time.
        \item Yes, there was a delay. Not as much a delay, but more as hard to register the small movements/notions.
        \item Yes. Either it turns a lot, or no turning at all. It got easier the more I tried.
        \item Delays when you turn left or right. Like having to make a very hard gesture for anything to happen.       
        \item You had to wait a little bit to see if a function worked or not.
        \item Yea. Turning. I don’t know about the speeder. I just tried to put the pedal to the metal.
        \item Turning delay was about a second.
        \item It laggs a little. But you got used to it.
        \item No, but I accidentally activated the screen shift. It’s about finding the right method for it.
        \item No. I didn’t think about that. The only problem was that it kept changing screen view point.

	\\
	\hline
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Not so responsive when turning the wheel. Sometimes it was really fast as well.
        \item Indicated that there were more problems with the functions activating itself, rather than non-responding functions. Ex. Change of view.
        \item The view or reverse did not work several times
        \item No. I did not notice it not turning. But changing camera enabled randomly.
        \item I had problems concerning the acceleration. I did not know if I was accelerating or not. (maybe because of the lighting or sound).
        \item Acceleration and braking worked pretty good.

	\\
	\hline
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Yes. Especially when trying to accelerate.” – Indicated moving the controller forward.
        \item Yes.  There was times where the control stopped working, or didn’t activate at all.
        \item Yes. Moving the controller too far behind was difficult.
        \item The activations were fine. Could require adjustments.
        \item Changed camera as an accident. Afterwards I didn’t dare try switching it back
        \item Very hard in the beginning. Once I got used to the distances, it got a lot easier.
        \item While driving reverse, it was too far behind. Like the distance from accelerating to de accelerating was too big.  It should be displaced a little.
        \item The camera view. I could not get it to work. It randomly changed back. I didn’t understand that.
        \item It worked pretty good except the sensitivity of the view point. Perhaps some body motions which conflicts with the  program.
        \item No, I won’t say that.
        \item It was mostly with the speed up. To figure out if it actually speeded up. Found that I had to flip the controller a little forward. But the camera should be a little further behind for it to work.

	\cellcolor{NotSkyBlue}\textbf{Did you experience any complications with enabling consecutive game functions (using functions together in context) that affected the gameplay? }
	\\
	\hline
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Sometimes it changed camera view all by itself. Changing it back worked quite well.
        \item No
        \item Because of the delay, suddenly changing direction became difficult.
        \item Acceleration and turning:  could go a little wrong.  When accelerating it was a little too much and turning, then the car is drifting off track.
        \item It’s hard since you must always keep your arms straight.  A tipping function to stopping or accelerating would be better. Then your arms is a little closer and therefore not so hard.
        \item When I wanted to voluntarily change view point, then it worked.
        \item That could be, when you dragged a little behind when trying to turn.
        \item I didn’t try to enable the screen view. But it randomly activated while I tried to turn.
        \item It was pretty difficult to start with, but that was because the car ended on the side, so there was not a lot of track to turn on. Perhaps it had a bit of difficulty registering what I wanted it to do.

	\\
	\hline
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Indicates putting the controller forward, overextending body is plausibly a complication.
        \item You get very tired of holding the controller, therefore you move it further and further down resulting in the controller suddenly not working as intended.
        \item The handling of the controller could have been constructed a little better. (also arms got tired)
        \item If the controller were more responsive, I think the handling would be okay.
        \item Once I found out how to handle the controller it was pretty funny.
        \item Not so precise
        \item Not normal
        \item Would like to “flip the controller” instead of turning with the arms.
        \item The controller was funny, but more “Wii like”. The controller is funny but there are many others that I would rather use.
        \item Arms hurt, but else quite funny.
        \item I would rather have a button for acceleration, so I could relax a little more.
        \item The only problem, was that it changed the view point. Also I was missing some sound.
        \item A little more weigh would have been good.
        \item Clumsy handling.
        \item I figured it out. I also found out, that if I placed the controller forward, I speeded up more.
        \item Feels too light. If it was on a stand, it would have been easier.
        \item Difficult. But you got used to it. So it can be done if you have strong arms.
        \item I think it was pretty cool. But the conceptual change of view point was disturbing. 
        \item It was difficult. You easily turned a lot one way. And then turning the other way.

        \item No
        \item No
        \item No, not at all
        \item No, not really. If you just place your fingers correct you can also change camera angle.

        \item No, I don’t think so. Except the automatic braking. It did that a lot

        \item No. I like the fact that you can put the controller on your legs. That was way better.
        \item It’s an Xbox controller, so one of those of course I don’t like (joking)
        \item More precise
        \item No, it was good to handle.
        \item Pretty comfortable.
        \item What work better is the small movements, since you are adjusting all the time. It works better
        \item Definitely the biggest difference is the small notions versus the big notions.
        \item The steering pen is pretty annoying. Else it is very comfortable
        \item No, pretty nice.
        \item No
        \item No, it is easier to handle. But the color controller is more authentic. Design wise is the most memorable.
        \item It was easy to handle
        \item More used to this controller. It’s more intuitive. Where your controller is more like  a steering wheel. This controller was a little more precise.
